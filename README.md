# Building a Modern Computer from First Principles
### My Nand2Tetris Journey

## Overview
This repository contains my progress through the **Nand2Tetris** (The Elements of Computing Systems) course. The goal is to build a complete computer system (hardware and software) starting from nothing but a NAND gate.

## The Stack
- **Hardware:** HDL
- **Assembler:** C++
- **Virtual Machine:** C++
- **Compiler:** C++
- **OS:** Jack
